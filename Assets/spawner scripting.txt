At top of hierarchy: Spawn Controller

	-calls the activate() method of each Enemy Wave one by one,
	 when the last enemy of a particular enemy wave is destroyed. *this check should be performed on each enemy deleted


Middle:	Enemy Wave

	-has an activate() method.
	-calls the spawn() function of each child spawner
	-stores a list of data with each entry specifying a spawner to spawn from and a point in time to spawn at
		int spawnerIndex = x		|	float time = y		
	
	- (alternative) have preset methods like sequential spawning which spawns each spawner in order at a certain interval
	foreach (SpawnEntry spawnEntry in spawnEntries) {
		if(deltaTime > spawnEntry.time && spawnEntry.ready)
			spawnEntry.spawner.spawn();
			spawnEntry.ready = false;
	}
	NO!!!!
	use Invoke()
	
Bottom: Spawner
	-spawns a single enemy of a single type when the spawn() method is called

Note that all of these objects should probably be static (ie. stationary) at all times, so that the enemies are not translated during their animation.
